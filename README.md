# Neovim Ranger

A plugin for using ranger inside neovim. This is forked from [panickbr/neovim-ranger](https://github.com/panickbr/neovim-ranger), modified to be able to select mutiple files instead of one. Code from [airodactyl/neovim-ranger](https://github.com/airodactyl/neovim-ranger) is also very helpful for me to figure it out.
